Well, I guess the title says it all: Hello World! I have known for a long time
that I should finally set up a webpage of my own where I can list my
publications, tell a bit about my research and share my insights, ideas and
enjoyment at discovering some new totally awesome tool or technology.
So what finally got me going? I guess the thing that finally got me to spend
the necessary few hours into setting up my own website was curiosity about
__GitHub Pages__.  The thing that motivates me the most to spend a few hours in
front of a computer tinkering with code is learning some new technologies and
the fact that GitHub pages uses `Jekyll` to render their webpages really got me
excited.

So I browsed the web, found [this excellent post](http://jponttuset.github.io/building-an-academic-website/)
on how to set-up an academic website, forked the [Minimal Mistakes
theme](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) and
liberally copied ideas (and code) from
[jponttuset.github.io](http://jponttuset.github.io). And here I am!

I still want to update quite a bit in the website and then I intend to start
blogging, sharing my ideas, projects, experiences and just stuff I don't want
to forget how to do. I hope you will enjoy this and that this will not be my
last post as well as my first :-)

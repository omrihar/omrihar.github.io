A colleague of mine recently introduced me to the philosopher [Manuel DeLanda][DeLanda]. After browsing his book collection on amazon I bought his [Philosophy and Simulation...][DeLandaBook] book and after the introduction and first chapter I was immediately hooked. To understand why I will try to explain a little about his philosophy as I understand it and how it relates to my own approach to the study of complex adaptive systems.

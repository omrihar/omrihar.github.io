A colleague of mine recently introduced me to the philosopher [Manuel DeLanda][DeLanda]. After browsing his book collection on amazon I bought his [Philosophy and Simulation...][DeLandaBook] book and after the introduction and first chapter I was immediately hooked. To understand why I will try to explain a little about his philosophy as I understand it and how it relates to my own approach to the study of complex adaptive systems.

DeLanda starts by talking about wholes, which are a collection of elements that together constitute a system. Wholes are made of parts, and one of the interesting questions is when can we talk about a meaningful whole. He talks about three interrelated concepts:

Emergent properties
: 	An Emergent property is a property of the whole which is not a property of its parts. A good example of a 	
		property is the sharpness of a knife. One can say a knife is sharp but it is meaningless to say that the 
		molecules making up the knife are sharp. The sharpness of the knife _emerges_ from the triangular arrangement of
		the molecules at the tip of the knife. Another Emergent property, which is very widely discussed, is 
		temperature. A gas can have a temperature which is related to the _average_ kinetic energy of the gas molecules. 
		A particular molecule cannot be said to have temperature of its own.

Capacities
:    The knife has a capacity to cut, because of its property of sharpness, and because there are other objects that can be cut. There are two distinguishing factors from properties: a capacity is usually contingent on a second object (if there were no objects that could be cut, the knife would not be able to cut. Secondly, unlike a property, a capacity does not have to occur (nothing has to be cut in order for it to exist) and when it does occur, it is an event (the knife cut the bread). A whole can have in principle an infinite number of capacities (a knife can also kill, or be used as a screwdriver, etc...). Emergent properties might depend on the capacities of the parts of a whole. For example, the knife's sharpness depends on the capacity of the iron molecules to bond to each other.

Tendencies
:    Another property of the knife is that it is solid. The metal can also be liquid or even gas, if we raise the temperature enough. These we call in physics _phases_, and DeLanda terms them _tendencies_. Like capacities they don't have to occur and when they do, it takes the form of an event (the knife melted). Unlike capacities, tendencies aren't contingent on a second object and they are often finite (there are several phases for a metal in its phase diagram).

Since both tendencies and capacities don't necessarily exist, DeLanda argues that it is interesting to look at the _structure_ of the space of probabilities ascribed to them. I think this is the point where this gets interesting, and converges to my own work.
